                Kathryn Church studied Psychology at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan (Masters 1983) and Sociology at OISE/University of Toronto (PhD 1993) during radical periods in the history of these departments. But it was psychiatric survivors who truly politicized her as she encountered them, their stories, and their activism while she was employed as an organizer in the mid-80s. These relationships propelled her into a decade of post-doctoral engagement as a “freelance” researcher working for and with psychiatric survivor organizations. Then, in 2002 she was drawn into Ryerson by the challenge of building a research program for the School of Disability Studies that would resonate with issues and debates in this emergent field.

            Dr. Peter Coppin, Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Design, is a
            designer, visual artist, and cognitive scientist. His work seeks to
            improve information access through a better understanding of how
            individuals make use of their diverse perceptual-motor capabilities to
            interact with interfaces and other designed artifacts (such as diagrams in
            problem solving or sonic interfaces to financial charts and graphs).
            </p>

            Dr. Coppin's work is informed by his career journey, which cuts across
            engineering, design, and the visual arts. Dr. Coppin has authored numerous
            articles that focus on the perceptual-cognitive aspects of information
            interfaces with applications in diverse areas such as diagrammatic
            reasoning, research on dyslexia, learning technology, telescience,
            human-robot interaction, and data analytics. His work with government
            agencies and industry has included numerous projects related to the
            visualization of complex Earth and planetary datasets for NASA. Recent
            work tackles the challenge of accessible data analytics: Interfaces that
            enable low vision or blind individuals to access charts and graphs without
            visual perception.

            Dr. Coppin's work has been funded by multiple NASA programs, the US

                Dr <span lang="fr">Desjardins'</span> academic career has been focused on the study of the role technology can play in the learning process at different levels.  In the past few years, that interest has moved towards mobile-learning and it’s potential to alter our thinking about pedagogy.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the former Associate Dean of Education (UOIT), Dr Desjardins was responsible for launching the Masters in Education and Digital Technology as well as the BA program in Adult Education and Digital Technology, both entirely offered online with regular face-to-face meetings in a desktop videoconferencing system.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is also the founding director of the Educational Informatics Lab at the Faculty of Education at UOIT, with projects focused on the study of the user experience with digital technology for learning, including work on adaptive technologies.  So far this has lead him to develop an epistemological model of Human-Computer-Human Interaction that served as the framework for the development of COLE (Collaborative Online Learning environment), a prototype designed to study student online preferences and interactions.  These and other projects in the EILab’s can offer the possibilities of examining how learners and their instructors interact not only with each other but with any other resources in real time and with a multitude of data collection systems.

These three identities come together for her at Ryerson, where she happily indulges her activist inclinations and curiosities about disability rights, disability arts and the place of disabled people in moral and political culture.  Drawing from her own experience of disablement as point of entry, she seeks to write and teach pathways into ethical and cultural dialogues about citizenship and personhood. Her present work is informed by many years of involvement in the equality struggles of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, most notably during a term as Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission from 1989 to 1992.

                He has been called a «human Internet», as his research and innovation work seeks to identify and connect the best minds, the best knowledge and the best tools across traditional boundaries to eliminate unnecessary suffering. Such work focuses on a radical 'glocal' innovation model designed to improve the capacity of humans to imagine, create and promote new and better approaches to living, healing, working and learning across the world. Powered by social networks and other leading-edge telecommunication tools, his projects attempt to anticipate and respond to major public health threats (e.g., multiple chronic conditions, pandemics) through strong and sustainable international collaboration, and to enable the public (particularly young people) to shape the health system and society.

                Dr. Pereyra's academic focus centres on interdisciplinary aspects of our multicultural society, as expressed through art, music, film, worship, multimedia, technology and sacred spaces. He is particularly interested in ritual spaces as iconic points of reference that provide unique meanings to the collective memory of a culture, and how creative experiences of transmitting information and communication can reach users and vice-versa. His Latin American, European and North American multi-cultural background greatly enrich his experience of the world and his scholarly work. Dr. Pereya organizes collaboration and community engagement of over 90 collaborating research organizations at the IDI, including managing the events and exhibits at the Open Gallery at 49 McCaul Street in Toronto.

In 2006, he established the <a href="http://encorelab.org">ENCORE lab</a>, a talented team of students, designers and developers who investigate collaborative inquiry learning in formal (K-12) and informal (home, field and museum) settings. In collaboration with researchers from Oslo, Chicago and Berkeley, Slotta and his team have developed the Scalable Architecture for Interactive Learning (SAIL), as well as a framework for smart classroom research called SAIL Smart Space.  Recent funded projects have examined the use of embedded phenomena in elementary classrooms, distributed and ubiquitous learning in high school physics, and an immersive rainforest simulation for high school biology.  Together, these projects have advanced a theoretical model known as Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI).  Professor Slotta and his team have published their work widely, with more than 50 papers presented at major conferences in the past three years.  Taken together, this work examines how students can become a knowledge community, supported by technology, to enable inclusive participation and promote the growth of ideas.

                All of her work in disability studies aims to explore the social meaning of embodiment as it is made manifest between people situated in world orders not of our own choosing.  Disability studies is then a place of critical inquiry where the meaning of our intersecting lives as bodies, minds, senses, emotions within complex webs of power and interpretations of normalcy can be explored and understood in new ways.

                Through both teaching and research, Tanya aims to examine how everyday life and social theory exclude and include disability within the politically charged interpretive milieu of social differences and desires, conflicts and commitments. As Principal Investigator of a standard SSHRC research grant, “The Cultural Production of Disability as an Excludable Type in University Life,” with co-investigator Dr. Rod Michalko, she is examining the ways in which educational contexts continue to include disability as an excludable type and how this relation is represented by images, texts, policy and programs that aim to fix, control, contain or manage disability within educational contexts.
