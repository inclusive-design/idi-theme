                Kathryn Church studied Psychology at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan (Masters 1983) and Sociology at OISE/University of Toronto (PhD 1993) during radical periods in the history of these departments. But it was psychiatric survivors who truly politicized her as she encountered them, their stories, and their activism while she was employed as an organizer in the mid-80s. These relationships propelled her into a decade of post-doctoral engagement as a “freelance” researcher working for and with psychiatric survivor organizations. Then, in 2002 she was drawn into Ryerson by the challenge of building a research program for the School of Disability Studies that would resonate with issues and debates in this emergent field.

In the past few years, that interest has moved towards mobile-learning and it’s potential to alter our thinking about pedagogy.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the former Associate Dean of Education (UOIT), Dr Desjardins was responsible for launching the Masters in Education and Digital Technology as well as the BA program in Adult Education and Digital Technology, both entirely offered online with regular face-to-face meetings in a desktop videoconferencing system.

            <p>
                He is also the founding director of the Educational Informatics Lab at the Faculty of Education at UOIT, with projects focused on the study of the user experience with digital technology for learning, including work on adaptive technologies.  So far this has lead him to develop an epistemological model of Human-Computer-Human Interaction that served as the framework for the development of COLE (Collaborative Online Learning environment), a prototype designed to study student online preferences and interactions.  These and other projects in the EILab’s can offer the possibilities of examining how learners and their instructors interact not only with each other but with any other resources in real time and with a multitude of data collection systems.

These three identities come together for her at Ryerson, where she happily indulges her activist inclinations and curiosities about disability rights, disability arts and the place of disabled people in moral and political culture.  Drawing from her own experience of disablement as point of entry, she seeks to write and teach pathways into ethical and cultural dialogues about citizenship and personhood. Her present work is informed by many years of involvement in the equality struggles of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, most notably during a term as Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission from 1989 to 1992.

                He has been called a «human Internet», as his research and innovation work seeks to identify and connect the best minds, the best knowledge and the best tools across traditional boundaries to eliminate unnecessary suffering. Such work focuses on a radical 'glocal' innovation model designed to improve the capacity of humans to imagine, create and promote new and better approaches to living, healing, working and learning across the world. Powered by social networks and other leading-edge telecommunication tools, his projects attempt to anticipate and respond to major public health threats (e.g., multiple chronic conditions, pandemics) through strong and sustainable international collaboration, and to enable the public (particularly young people) to shape the health system and society.

                Marlene Scardamalia holds the Presidents' Chair in Education and Knowledge Technologies at OISE/University of Toronto and directs IKIT, the Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology—a worldwide network of innovators working to advance the frontiers of knowledge building in various sectors. "Knowledge building," a term now widely used in education and knowledge management, originated with the CSILE/Knowledge Building project. Marlene led the team that created CSILE (Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments), which was the first networked knowledge building environment for education. The second generation version of this technology, <a href="http://www.knowledgeforum.com/">Knowledge Forum®</a>, is in use in countries worldwide, in education, health, business, and professional organizations. Knowledge building theories, models, practices and technologies have been developed in partnership with Carl Bereiter and team members.

                Jim Slotta is an associate professor of education in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at The University of Toronto, where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Education and Technology.  In 2006, he established the <a href="http://encorelab.org">ENCORE lab</a>, a talented team of students, designers and developers who investigate collaborative inquiry learning in formal (K-12) and informal (home, field and museum) settings. In collaboration with researchers from Oslo, Chicago and Berkeley, Slotta and his team have developed the Scalable Architecture for Interactive Learning (SAIL), as well as a framework for smart classroom research called SAIL Smart Space.  Recent funded projects have examined the use of embedded phenomena in elementary classrooms, distributed and ubiquitous learning in high school physics, and an immersive rainforest simulation for high school biology.  Together, these projects have advanced a theoretical model known as Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI).  Professor Slotta and his team have published their work widely, with more than 50 papers presented at major conferences in the past three years.  Taken together, this work examines how students can become a knowledge community, supported by technology, to enable inclusive participation and promote the growth of ideas.

                Tanya Titchkosky pursues research and teaching in Disability Studies (DS). She does this work from her perspective as dyslexic and with an interpretive sociological approach informed by phenomenology; hermeneutics; critical disability, race, and queer theory. Along with being a full member of School of Graduate Studies (SGS), and part of the Women and Gender Studies Institute, U of T, she is also an Honorary Research Associate at the University of New Brunswick.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of her work in disability studies aims to explore the social meaning of embodiment as it is made manifest between people situated in world orders not of our own choosing.  Disability studies is then a place of critical inquiry where the meaning of our intersecting lives as bodies, minds, senses, emotions within complex webs of power and interpretations of normalcy can be explored and understood in new ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through both teaching and research, Tanya aims to examine how everyday life and social theory exclude and include disability within the politically charged interpretive milieu of social differences and desires, conflicts and commitments. As Principal Investigator of a standard SSHRC research grant, “The Cultural Production of Disability as an Excludable Type in University Life,” with co-investigator Dr. Rod Michalko, she is examining the ways in which educational contexts continue to include disability as an excludable type and how this relation is represented by images, texts, policy and programs that aim to fix, control, contain or manage disability within educational contexts.
