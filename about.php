		Kathryn Church studied Psychology at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan (Masters 1983) and Sociology at OISE/University of Toronto (PhD 1993) during radical periods in the history of these departments. But it was psychiatric survivors who truly politicized her as she encountered them, their stories, and their activism while she was employed as an organizer in the mid-80s. These relationships propelled her into a decade of post-doctoral engagement as a “freelance” researcher working for and with psychiatric survivor organizations. Then, in 2002 she was drawn into Ryerson by the challenge of building a research program for the School of Disability Studies that would resonate with issues and debates in this emergent field.  </p>

		Dr <span lang="fr">Desjardins'</span> academic career has been focused on the study of the role technology can play in the learning process at different levels.  In the past few years, that interest has moved towards mobile-learning and it’s potential to alter our thinking about pedagogy.
		</p>
		<p>
		As the former Associate Dean of Education (UOIT), Dr Desjardins was responsible for launching the Masters in Education and Digital Technology as well as the BA program in Adult Education and Digital Technology, both entirely offered online with regular face-to-face meetings in a desktop videoconferencing system.
		</p>
		<p>
		He is also the founding director of the Educational Informatics Lab at the Faculty of Education at UOIT, with projects focused on the study of the user experience with digital technology for learning, including work on adaptive technologies.  So far this has lead him to develop an epistemological model of Human-Computer-Human Interaction that served as the framework for the development of COLE (Collaborative Online Learning environment), a prototype designed to study student online preferences and interactions.  These and other projects in the EILab’s can offer the possibilities of examining how learners and their instructors interact not only with each other but with any other resources in real time and with a multitude of data collection systems.

		Professor Slotta’s current research explores new models of technology-enhanced learning for “smart classrooms.”  His designs employ cutting edge technologies such as peer-to-peer networks, geographic information systems, multi-user virtual environments, probeware and cell phone systems in order to scaffold complex curriculum structures and patterns of interactions between students.   In order to deliver on the promise of open source and open content materials for education, he has helped to organize a dynamic international community of researchers and technologists who are designing common technology frameworks and exchanging tools and materials. Professor Slotta has published and presented widely concerning the opportunities, challenges and llimitations of technology-based environments.

		Brian Cantwell Smith is Dean of the Faculty of Information Studies at University of Toronto, Professor in the departments of Philosophy and Computer Science, and Canada Research Chair in the Foundations of Information.

		Smith's research focuses on the conceptual foundations of computation, information, and cognitive science, and on the use of computational metaphors in such fields as biology, physics, and art. These investigations have increasingly led him into metaphysics -- specifically, to an attempt to lay out a systematic metaphysics that aims (i) to steer a path between realism and constructivism, (ii) to account for the integrated emergence of subject and object, and (iii) to reconcile our causal and normative understandings of the world ("matter" and "mattering"). A first cut at this project was first described in On the Origin of Objects (MIT, 1996). A multi-volume study of the foundations of computing, The Age of Significance, is being simultaneously published by MIT Press and serially, on the web, over a period of five or six years (at www.ageofsig.org).
