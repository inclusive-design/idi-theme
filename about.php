		Kathryn Church studied Psychology at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan (Masters 1983) and Sociology at OISE/University of Toronto (PhD 1993) during radical periods in the history of these departments. But it was psychiatric survivors who truly politicized her as she encountered them, their stories, and their activism while she was employed as an organizer in the mid-80s. These relationships propelled her into a decade of post-doctoral engagement as a “freelance” researcher working for and with psychiatric survivor organizations. Then, in 2002 she was drawn into Ryerson by the challenge of building a research program for the School of Disability Studies that would resonate with issues and debates in this emergent field.  </p>

		He has been called a «human Internet», as his research and innovation work seeks to identify and connect the best minds, the best knowledge and the best tools across traditional boundaries to eliminate unnecessary suffering. Such work focuses on a radical 'glocal' innovation model designed to improve the capacity of humans to imagine, create and promote new and better approaches to living, healing, working and learning across the world. Powered by social networks and other leading-edge telecommunication tools, his projects attempt to anticipate and respond to major public health threats (e.g., multiple chronic conditions, pandemics) through strong and sustainable international collaboration, and to enable the public (particularly young people) to shape the health system and society.

		Brian Cantwell Smith is Dean of the Faculty of Information Studies at University of Toronto, Professor in the departments of Philosophy and Computer Science, and Canada Research Chair in the Foundations of Information.
		</p>
		<p>
		Smith's research focuses on the conceptual foundations of computation, information, and cognitive science, and on the use of computational metaphors in such fields as biology, physics, and art. These investigations have increasingly led him into metaphysics -- specifically, to an attempt to lay out a systematic metaphysics that aims (i) to steer a path between realism and constructivism, (ii) to account for the integrated emergence of subject and object, and (iii) to reconcile our causal and normative understandings of the world ("matter" and "mattering"). A first cut at this project was first described in On the Origin of Objects (MIT, 1996). A multi-volume study of the foundations of computing, The Age of Significance, is being simultaneously published by MIT Press and serially, on the web, over a period of five or six years (at www.ageofsig.org).
